### **Mass Layoffs Across Federal Agencies**

**Summary:** The Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), led by Elon Musk, initiated extensive layoffs across multiple federal agencies as part of a significant downsizing effort. Reports indicate that some employees were given as little as 30 minutes to vacate their offices. Up to 200,000 workers may be affected, with further layoffs anticipated. The American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE) has condemned these actions, citing a lack of notice and due process.
