### **Legal Actions Against DOGE's Access to Federal Data**

**Summary:** Multiple legal challenges have been initiated against DOGE's access to sensitive federal data:

- **Treasury Data Access:** Nineteen state attorneys general filed a lawsuit in the Southern District of New York, alleging that DOGE's access to Treasury data violates constitutional principles. Judge Paul A. Engelmayer issued a preliminary injunction barring DOGE from accessing Treasury data and ordered the deletion of any unauthorized copies.

- **Department of Education Data Access:** The University of California Student Association filed a lawsuit against the Department of Education, claiming DOGE's access to student loan data constitutes an unprecedented intrusion into individual privacy.

- **USAID Shutdown:** The American Foreign Service Association and the American Federation of Government Employees filed a lawsuit seeking to halt the shutdown of USAID. Judge Carl J. Nichols issued a temporary restraining order against plans to place 2,200 employees on administrative leave and recall overseas USAID workers.

**Impact:**
- **Operational Restrictions:** These legal actions have temporarily halted DOGE's access to certain federal data systems and paused the planned shutdown of USAID.

- **Increased Scrutiny:** The lawsuits have intensified public and legal scrutiny of DOGE's methods and authority.

### **Implementation of New Government Payment Reporting Requirements**

**Summary:** Elon Musk announced that the Treasury Department and DOGE have instituted new reporting requirements for all outgoing government payments. Each payment will now include a "payment categorization code" for auditing purposes and must provide a rationale in a comment field. The "do-not-pay" list will also be updated more frequently, ideally on a weekly or daily basis. Musk criticized the absence of these measures previously and alleged that Treasury staff identified about $50 billion in clear fraud within entitlement payments, though he did not provide evidence.

**Impact:**
- **Enhanced Oversight:** The new measures aim to improve auditing and reduce fraudulent payments within government expenditures.

- **Operational Changes:** Government agencies will need to adjust their payment processes to comply with the new reporting requirements.

### **Court Ruling on DOGE's Access to Labor Department Systems**

**Summary:** A federal judge declined to block DOGE from accessing the U.S. Department of Labor's systems. The ruling is part of a lawsuit by the AFL-CIO, which claims that DOGE's access could expose sensitive investigation information and disrupt critical programs. The union expressed concerns that Musk's control over government systems might allow him to obtain data on competitors and federal employees.

**Impact:**
- **Continued Access:** DOGE retains access to the Department of Labor's systems, allowing it to continue its initiatives within the department.

- **Ongoing Legal Challenges:** The decision highlights the ongoing legal battles surrounding DOGE's access to federal data and systems.
